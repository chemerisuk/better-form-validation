# better-dom [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/chemerisuk/better-dom.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/chemerisuk/better-dom)
> Live extension playground

jQuery knows a concept called “**live events**”. Using the idea of event delegation they enabled developers to handle existing and future elements. But there are a lot of cases when more flexibility is required. For example, delegated events fall short when the DOM needs to be mutated in order to initialize a widget. Therefore I'd like to introduce **live extensions**.

There is a section in the [Web Components](http://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/) spec called “[Decorators](http://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/#decorator-section)” which is trying to solve a similar problem. Currently it uses a markup-based implementation with a special syntax for attaching event listeners on child elements. But the concept is still an early draft:

> Decorators, unlike other parts of Web Components, do not have a specification yet.

## Installation
The simplest way is to use [bower](http://bower.io/):

    bower install better-dom --save

This will clone the latest version of the __better-dom__ with dependencies into the `bower_components` directory at the root of your project. Then just include scripts below on your web page:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    ...
    <!--[if IE]>
        <link href="bower_components/better-dom/dist/better-dom-legacy.htc" rel="htc"/>
        <script src="bower_components/better-dom/dist/better-dom-legacy.js"></script>
    <![endif]-->
</head>
<body>
    ...
    <script src="bower_components/better-dom/dist/better-dom.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Notes about old IEs
For IE8-9 support you have to incude the conditional comment above with 2 extra elements into `<head>`. The excellent [html5shiv](https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv) provides fix for new HTML5 tags and [es5-shim](https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim) is used to polyfill missed standards-based functions. These projects are bundled into **better-dom-legacy.js** with other fixes.

The **better-dom-legacy.htc** file helps to implement [live extensions](https://github.com/chemerisuk/better-dom/wiki/Live-extensions) support. This fact applies several important limitations that you must know in case when legacy browser support is required.

#### Setup content-type header
HTC behaviors have to serve up with a content-type header of “text/x-component”, otherwise IE will simply ignore the file. Many web servers are preconfigured with the correct content-type, but others are not.

    AddType text/x-component .htc

#### Same domain limitation
IE requires that the HTC file must be in the same domain with as the HTML page which uses it. If you try to load the behavior from a different domain, you will get an “Access Denied” error.

## Browser support
* Chrome
* Safari 6.0+
* Firefox 16+
* Opera 12.10+
* IE8+
